A simple Taxi (Uber) Mobile App.
Technologies used: Use React Native, Expo SDK, Redux for state management library, Google Cloud API (place API and distance API), and Tailwind for the style.
Allow users to search a route from origin to destination and estimate the price based on the distance of that route.
I am still working on it to complete all the features in my app.
